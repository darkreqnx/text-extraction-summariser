As well as taking fruit, barbets also take arthropod prey, gleaned from the branches and trunks of trees.
Although none of the Asian barbets are considered threatened, several species are known to be intolerant of deforestation and require old-growth forest to thrive.
Asian barbets are usually birds of the inner forest.
 The family name is derived from that of the genus Megalaima which means ‘large throat’, from the Greek mega (μέγας, ‘large, great’) and laimos (λαιμός, ‘throat’). 



Figs of the genus Ficus are the most important fruit taken by Asian barbets.
